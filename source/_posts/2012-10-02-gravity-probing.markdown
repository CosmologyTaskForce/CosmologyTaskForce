## Eotvos Torsion Balance

Detection of $R^k_{0l0}=(1/c^2)\partial^2\Phi/\partial x^k\partial x^l \sim 10^{-32} \text{cm}^{-2}$.


## Hughes-Drevershiy Experiment, etc

Anisotropy of gravitation/electromagnetism is not proved in our galaxy.




## Summary Table




|  |  Experiment   | Results | Note |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | -----: |
| WEP | Eotvos torsion balance[[^1]] |    $\eta = (0.3 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{-13}$    |   More precise in space exp.   |
| EEP |     |       |    |
