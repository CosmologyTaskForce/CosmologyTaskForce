Galaxy surveys is a powerful way of exploring the large scale structure of the universe, as well as a way of testing the theory of gravity.

## CfA Redshift Survey

**CfA Redshift Survey**, [the Center for Astrophysics Redshift Survey](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~dfabricant/huchra/zcat), is the first redshift survey.

* **Objectives**: Measure radial velocities for all galaxies brighter than 14.5 and high galactic latitude in the merged catalogs of Zwicky and Nilson (UGC). | **Completed**

* **Parameters**: 
  * Facilities: 
  * Frequency/Channel:
  * Objects: Galaxies | about 18,000 measured.
  * Distance: Within redshift 15,000 km/s
  * Area: Northern sky
  * Resolution:

**Results**
Distribution of the galaxies in the northern celestial hemisphere with an apparent blue magnitude of 15.5 inside redshift 15,000 km/s,

In this map,

* Red V < 3000 km/s
* Blue 3000 < V < 6000 km/s
* Magenta 6000 < V < 9000 km/s
* Cyan 9000 < V < 12000 km/s
* Green 12000 < V km/s

## 2dF Galaxy Redshift

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2dF_Galaxy_Redshift_Survey); [offical site](http://www2.aao.gov.au/2dFGRS)

**2dFGRS**, spectroscopic survey, is integrated with the 2dF QSO survey.

* Objects:245591, mainly galaxies, brighter than a nominal extinction-corrected magnitude limit of $b_J = 19.45$. Reliable (quality>=3) redshifts were obtained for 221414 galaxies.

* Area, 1500 square degrees. A figure from official site is shown below.

* Galaxy distribution results from completed survey:

**2dF QSO Redshift Survey**, 2QZ. Already integrated into 2dFGRS.

* Objects: Magnitude limits are $18.25<b_J<20.85$. Color selection is $u-b_J$ vs. $b_J-r$ plane.

**6dF QSO Redshift Survey**

* Objects: limits $16.0<b_J<18.25$.

## 2 MASS Redshift Survey

**2MASS**, the [Two Micron All Sky Survey](http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass), "is designed to close the gap between our current technical capability and our knowledge of the near-infared sky. In addition to providing a contex for the interpretation of results obtained at infrared and other wavelengths." It shows the large-scale structure of the Milky Way and the Local universe.

* Objects: Limited. to local universe.
* Area: All sky scanning
* Band: 3 near-infared bands.
* Reslution: pixel size 2.0".RNR>10.


**2MRS**, the 2MASS Redshif Survey, aims to map the distribution of galaxies and dark matter in the local universe, based on galaxy selectian of 2MASS.

* Objects: Aim to 45000 galaxies up to K=11.75mag. This is completed.
* Redshift out to $z=0.03$ (mean value), or equivalently to 115Mpc/370 million light-years.
* Band: near infra-red J,H and K-band.

* All sky map of local universe in infared
