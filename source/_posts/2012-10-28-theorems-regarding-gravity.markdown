In general relavity, many theorems provides deep understanding of gravity.

## Lovelock's Theorem

**The only possible second-order Euler-Lagrange expression obtainable in a four dimensional space from a scalar density of the form $\scr L = \scr L(g_{\mu\nu})$ is**

$$E^{\mu\nu} = \alpha \sqrt{-g} [ R^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu}R ] +\lambda \sqrt{-g} g^{\mu\nu} $$


Thus modification could be

*  Metric tensor not a fundamental tensor
*  Higher than second order derivatives of the metric in the field equations
*  Not a four dimension space
*  Not rank (2,0) tensor field equations, non-symmetry of field equations under exchange of indices, or divergence field equations
*  non-locality



## Birkhoff's Theorem


**All spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's equations in vacuum must be static and asymptotically flat, without $\Lambda$**

Actually, this can be extended to a $\Lambda$ space only keeping the static result. 



## No-hair Theorems

**The generic final state of gravitational collapse is a Kerr-Newman black hole, fully specified by its mass, angular momentum and charge**

Also, "in the context of General Relativity with a cosmological constant all expanding universe solutions should evolve towards de Sitter space."[[^no-hair_theorem_1]] This is only valid in some situation.
